Use the student data as basic for analysis.

Pick 2 years: Y1, and Y2.

Use Y1 as data and Y2 for prediction.

Predict Y2 mathSS and readSS from Y1. Use any columns you like.

Estimate how accurate your data was.

Find out which dimensions of the data you can drop without loosing
much accuracy.

Divide the population of two years to students that will be used for building
the model and students that will be used for checking the model (by percentage
or any other means).

No need for anything more complicated than a linear model.

Use:
- Chi-Squared for testing which columns are significant.
- lm() for linear modeling.

Write everything as a script.
