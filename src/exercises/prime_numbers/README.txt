Print the prime numbers up to a 100.
Use what ever method you like...:)

You can use the following methods:
1. Erathosthenes sieve.
	Write down all the numbers from 1..100
	Strike down every number (except 2) which
		divides by 2.
	Strike down every number (except 3) which
		divides by 3.
	...
	Strike down every number (except 10) which
		divides by 10.
	Every number left standing is prime.
2. Check each number on its own up to its root.
3. Check each number against the prime numbers
	which are smaller from it
	(BEST METHOD! EXTRA POINTS!)

Use functions! use vectors! use matrices!
