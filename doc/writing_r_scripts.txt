Here is how to write R scripts:
- open any text editor of your pleasing and write your script
- save it to a file with the suffix .R (convention only).
- run it via 'Rscript myfile.R'

On Linux/Unix
=============
You can turn you script into a real executable file by:
1) making it executable (chmod +x [myfile.R])
2) adding a SHEBANG first line to it. Either:
	#!/usr/bin/Rscript
	or
	#!/usr/bin/env Rscript
