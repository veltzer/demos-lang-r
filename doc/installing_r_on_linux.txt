In order to install R on Linux you usually need to install a couple of packages
via your regular package manager of your distro.

On Ubuntu you need the following packages:
	'r-base-core' <- this is the real R language
	'r-doc-pdf', <- documentation in pdf format
	'r-doc-html', <- documentation in html format
	'r-doc-info' <- documentation in info format

On windows just install the executable.
